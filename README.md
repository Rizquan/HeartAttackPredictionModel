👤 My Contribution (Group Project)

This repository represents my individual contribution to a university group project on heart attack risk prediction using machine learning.

My Responsibility

Implemented and evaluated the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model
Performed data preprocessing, including feature scaling and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and improve distance-based model performance
Conducted hyperparameter tuning to identify the optimal K value
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
Analyzed model behavior in a healthcare context with emphasis on minimizing false negatives

Note

The complete project includes contributions from multiple team members.
This repository focuses only on my assigned responsibility.
